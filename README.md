# Plate Recognition Tool

In this very simple plate recognition tool I am trying to, given some pretermined plate photos, identify automatically the alphanumeric string of the plate. Since it is a small project done for a course of my master degree, I could not use any types of neural networks or other complicated machine learning tecnique. 

Nevertheless, I am going to show every step I did in order to build this small project, at the end there will be listed some possible future implementations.

First of all I imported all the library that will be useful during the script:
```python

```
